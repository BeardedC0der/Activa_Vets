<p>
	SuprasorbA+Ag is for moderate to heavily exuding wounds. Alginate dressings are derived from seaweed and turn to a gel in contact with exudate. The gel helps prevent maceration and maintain a moist wound environment.

<p>
	Contains silver for contaminated, colonised or critically colonised wounds. The addition of antimicrobial silver kills bacteria in the wound. The dressing can remain in place for 7 days.
